User Guide

Open a terminal from GIT_WORDCOUNT directory. Run the script with the 2 arguments.

Argument 1 = text file
Argument 2 = frequency of repeating words per line (currently only accepts integers 1, 2, 3)

Example:
python wordcount.py badpoem.txt 2

#####

Future versions will include:

1)
Replace any special character in [input].txt to empty string - Confidently cleaning the text before script continues.

2)
Store as many lines as the input text file has, rather than the set amount of 4.

3)
Use loops for elif section - Making script more efficient and usable on any txt file.

4)
Store and get from lists in a more efficient way.

5)
Turn script into a module to be imported in another .py script.
